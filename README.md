# guess-the-number
A simple game I built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## Rules
Guess any number between 1 and 100
Based on the input there will be 2 messages.
  1. Too low/low/high/too high
  2. Hotter/colder 
Continue guessing until you get the right number.
Guess the right number and get rewarded with a meme.
